</header><p>
In the boat, I slide over her body, the excavation. 
She is slag. She is crushed stone. 
Unburied, geologic, Mesabi iron. 
I drift over knee and shin and float over her shattered self, heaped upon the earth. 
Over boulders submerged. 
Veins broken open, emptied and made into freight.
</p><p>
A cold current from the drift. 
The bow lifts. 
She is bedrock, the bottom of the continent. 
Through her runs dark and invisible rivers without shore. She is the Divide. 
In the seams of the tectonic plates, she is lit with dynamite and extracted, mined, carried by trains to the ships. 
I see a shoulder of iron. 
In place of her spine, a deep shaft.
</p><p>
Remade, she becomes steel, becomes bridge, becomes beam. 
Ship and tank and weapon. 
At the end, junk in the junkyards rusting into the weeds.
</p><p>
^<br/>
The vessel turns like the needle of a compass broken from its post. 
I hear the tail splash of a trout. 
Fish spiral along the perimeter inside the pit. 
Inside, a winding road once traveled, in shifts, by men in hard hats in dump trucks and steam shovels. 
The trout tend the broken cables, the skeletal rusted frames.
</p><p>
Stained with ore, the water feels like ice. 
It rises. 
Engineers call it water gain: precipitation, surface water inflow, a rise in the water table, a threat to the walls of the pit. 
Light falls but can’t find bottom three hundred feet below. 
Circles tumble and bend beneath the water’s surface. 
I hear the gravel sliding in. 
I hear insects and bird wings over the factory of the deep.
</p><p>
^<br/>
Cold blue from afar, the water goes amber. 
It magnifies the hand that I plunge beneath the surface. 
It breaks the lines of my body, her body,
the vessel. 
Ore rises into dust, condenses into a red mist of atoms, becomes discharge, industrial contamination. 
We break the surface. 
We sink and rise.

		<i>An acre of music or a room closer to it</i><br/> —Lorine Niedecker
		</div><p>
^<br/>
The minerals whisper: iron, manganese,<br/>
copper, nickel, platinum, and titanium.<br/>
On the Laurentian Divide, one river falls over stones<br/>
to Hudson Bay. Another falls south through fields<br/>
to the Mississippi. The third river goes east<br/>
through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Handfuls of water. A body of sea smoke, of wind,<br/>
a body of motion, an ocean without salt.<br/>
In the benthos, tailings from taconite mines.<br/>
In the basin, shipwrecks and broken bottles and sunken<br/>
barrels and bodies the lake has claimed.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
On a bridge made of paper, my voice turns to vapor.<br/>
On a bridge made of iron and steel<br/>
I veer between traction and black ice<br/>
wander through beams and woven branches<br/>
follow the rain in its tracks through roots and excavations.<br/>
I cross before, almost, never,<br/>
the thunder of interior dialogues<br/>
through heavy machinery.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Practicing the old art,<br/>
my father once crossed the slope<br/>
holding a slender branch, calling the water.<br/>
Divining. Now, in a dark room, a daughter holds<br/>
a cello to her breast. In the instrument is the old tree.<br/>
The wood turns toward harmonics.<br/>
The bow rises, glides, floats above the bridge.<br/>
Calls of the geese overhead vibrate<br/>
against the windowpane. Her fingers tremble<br/>
like strings and the water answers.<br/>
A car comes down the street. The driver<br/>
locked in a dream, rolls down the hill. Slower.<br/>
Still. The branch dips and the invisible flows<br/>
into containers. The forked branch<br/>
didn’t know it had lost its root.<br/>
It only had yearning.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
I call the rivers in the forgotten language<br/>
call the Sawtooth Mountains,<br/>
forested slopes with snowshoe hares and deer beds<br/>
and bears’ dens and lynx.<br/>
I call shore’s perpetual threshold.<br/>
In the city, in a house, I call a moth<br/>
caught between two panes of glass.<br/>
To catch it will damage the wings.<br/>
To leave it means it will perish.<br/>
I write of the trapped and desperate flight.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
No one can follow the map of the bees.<br/>
Their business is in every direction,<br/>
from tiger lilies into the hives to the chives<br/>
to other realms with heads of clover.<br/>
Apple blossoms. In the lavender colonnades<br/>
of mint through the rooms of June<br/>
into purple irises, yellow daylilies, deep inside<br/>
delicate tunnels with hardly a foothold<br/>
hidden in clouds of pollen.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Along Fourth Street, the rapids climb a bed of stones<br/>
amid revelers, but alone<br/>
over a steep slope with winter’s melt<br/>
below a bridge, a bird on a wire, hidden by trees<br/>
past a canvas tent and pillow with nobody home.<br/>
The constellation of Orion<br/>
roams through clouds and goes on a shifting path<br/>
with the sleepless river, plunging deep.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A river catches herself as she is falling.<br/>
She is a cloud that breaks open and the earth<br/>
that holds the seed as it is broken.<br/>
The farther she has gone, the closer she comes.<br/>
The more she is lost, the more she has found.<br/>
Her body is formed by what she touches.<br/>
Blind, she sees. Deaf, she hears.<br/>
The wind is her breathing. In her emptiness<br/>
she fills. In her erasures, she is writing.<br/>
The colder the air, the deeper she goes.<br/>
The more it rains, the more rain she carries.<br/>
The more stones in her path, the more that she laughs.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A blueprint on a scroll of paper: a bridge is built<br/>
for floating on air, but heavily, on pylons<br/>
wading in plaits of current.<br/>
Passengers go between steel cables and arches<br/>
and bows, through quicksilver and mercury and yellow.<br/>
The homeless meander below.<br/>
This bridge, made to join, to cast a permanent shadow.<br/>
This bridge, made to resist wind and gravity.<br/>
This bridge made, above all, to echo and hum.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Between steel rails on ramps of forward and back<br/>
I merge in the traffic. In the union of opposing forces<br/>
accelerating through ribs of steel and spider webs.<br/>
Once in a dark kitchen, there was an old woman sifting.<br/>
The flour falls through the screen.<br/>
Once the oil of the lamp climbed a wick<br/>
lit a small conflagration above the round oak table<br/>
in a circle of chairs, a murmuring, a call for grace.<br/>
The roar of a flame mingles with<br/>
the chink of forks and knives.<br/>
A man, injured in the mine, lies in his bed.<br/>
On the bridge, red brake lights. Cars surge<br/>
past a blur of years suspended in fine dust.<br/>
The bridge sways.<br/> 
Wheels stir the filaments, litter drifts<br/>
where words can’t reach.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
On foot. On the span, falling without falling.<br/>
Say I cross the bridge,<br/>
although it is windy and missteps are fatal.<br/>
Say clouds cover the moon and I cross borders<br/>
without knowing. Say the wind blows at my clothes,<br/>
strips me of my protection<br/>
and I lose my footing. Say I fall through the night<br/>
break through the surface in a cold fire.<br/>
Say I vacate — abandon my saying,<br/>
withdraw my breath, take my hands from my hands,<br/>
twist from my shoulders. Say I walk or am carried<br/>
to the place before birth, the place where the sun<br/>
comes as a ribbon of heat.<br/>
Say I arrive in another language,<br/>
wings lifting and landing,<br/>
to speak with a wild tongue.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Here, a sketch of shore. The pencil draws<br/>
a water line, a vanishing point. In graphite,<br/>
wings of a bird in flight. Two more curves,<br/>
parabolas that float. Next, between the boat’s ribs, a bench.<br/>
A wave on the water’s surface — not much — just grasses<br/>
bent beneath a wind. Then a shadow, three-dimensional.<br/>
There’s a need to leave things out. In the silence<br/>
those that peer uneasily, advance, and then withdraw.<br/>
Granite outcroppings — broken by ice.<br/>
Already the currents pull and the hull lifts and sways,
restless. I render this as if I were — disembarked —<br/>
without a body, without a shadow, a current of air.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Jointed and broken, the skeletal hand raked the beach.<br/>
It drifted and reached, five long finger bones bleached<br/>
and worn clean. A hand and nothing else.<br/>
Was it a bear? A deceased? Wind blew from the northeast.<br/>
No other bones to be seen — no other walkers.<br/>
Grass was chased over the dunes. Trees leaned<br/>
away from the sea. Clouds lifted in each crest.<br/>
Pebbles unsettled the bottom, rode through the knuckles<br/>
and left no print. The water was sky,<br/>
clear and tinted with old blood or rust, rot of fish<br/>
and soft ice. Inside were rivers and constellations,<br/>
storm wrecks and lives ground into splinters.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the hollow of the body, a crow comes with a sharp beak.<br/>
The door of the chamber opens and closes.<br/>
I cannot translate this well. The arteries are open.<br/>
There is nothing apparent, the same pressure as always.<br/>
Life goes on. The crow grows a long shadow<br/>
and takes short flights along low branches.<br/>
I walk under the trees when the days are short.<br/>
The crow flaps its rough wings and squawks.<br/>
This what you call death, she says, I eat.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Here, bulbs are forced to bloom. They are planted<br/>
in the ground before winter.<br/>
Here, mouths are filled with soil. Those<br/>
who entered the tomb and grew roots<br/>
and walked in cold layers<br/>
to draw the minerals out. Those are the ones<br/>
who yield to the shovel and receive the bones,<br/>
those are the ones who weave a net and lift the stones.<br/>
There are those who seep or are swept<br/>
into the underground river, who decay and are kept and yet,<br/>
rise in a tender green stem to carry new buds.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
I walk over the narrow holes of diamond drillers.<br/>
Above the horizon, seagulls draw arcs in flight.<br/>
In the morning on shore, sandpipers run on wet sand.<br/>
Feathers lift and fall, driven by wind’s breath.<br/>
I find, half buried in the sand, lost thresholds.<br/>
Scrolls of birchbark, small arches, angles<br/>
and grayed frames of doors that once opened and closed.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the city are those who cannot be traced.<br/>
In the city of good air and bad are ghost cities,<br/>
old cities, cities of war with lamps that no longer burn<br/>
but pierce the tongue, cities that write in smoke<br/>
in a book open to depredations and<br/>
cities that reassemble endings in a dark room<br/>
of unknown dimensions, suspend belief,<br/>
upend the fields. In the city, I affix the disappeared<br/>
to sheets of onion skin with stains and smudges.<br/>
Trans-literate. Splice the image.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
My hand disappears over the horizon<br/>
and pulls up the sea for cover.<br/>
I travel as a cloud for miles, citizen of a bruised sky.<br/>
I cross the tides to climb the coast<br/>
follow roads to the interior<br/>
and rivers flow over my banks.<br/>
My border spans the continents, and my spine<br/>
grows into a mountain range.<br/>
My arms can’t carry the load.<br/>
The cast off, the rejected, the driven<br/>
and defenseless. Everywhere they come forth,<br/>
everywhere off course.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Seagulls wheel. The hidden drifts.<br/>
Freighters and ships embark<br/>
in the harbor, trembling with heat,<br/>
breathe cold vapor<br/>
and speak in the language of horns.<br/>
In their wake, the undocumented<br/>
travel with currents that carry the vessel.<br/>
May it not sink.<br/>
May they not be detained or taken by claw or beak<br/>
or roll like driftwood on the bottom of the sea<br/>
but rise to their feet and climb the beach.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
To swing like a branch in a storm<br/>
whose edges are accelerating,<br/>
to heave with the waves in the slant of hurled rain.<br/>
To hear the thump and crack in the too-early dark,<br/>
see the electric pour into a hollow.<br/>
To find a vein and excavate,<br/>
see absences in the landscape.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Strangers come to the edge and double back<br/>
because vessels are small and voices can carry,<br/>
because children are heavy and nothing is cheap,<br/>
because destinations are far and some roads lead nowhere<br/>
because fences are one thing and rivers another,<br/>
because rocks rise beneath the feet<br/>
and holes can be deep, because we look<br/>
at the water and don’t see any crossings,<br/>
because journeys disappear and time erases the map,<br/>
because words cloud the distance<br/>
between us, because no matter how many have made it<br/>
or how many have foundered, they still come,<br/>
because what falls from our grasp lands in the past,<br/>
because when the wind rises, waves make mountains to climb.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Difficult, to move a border. To clear a forest.<br/>
Difficult even to open the furrows<br/>
in the field. We lift the seeds and scatter.<br/>
If we don’t cut every year, the forest will take over.<br/>
Imagine a beaver on the sandbar of Lake Superior.<br/>
She slides into the surf and emerges<br/>
with a piece of driftwood, in that heavy surf,<br/>
and lays the first beam of her house.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the forest, most seeds flung by wind or wings<br/>
never sprout. Seedlings compete for the smallest bit of sun.<br/>
A white pine, one hundred feet tall,<br/>
can be felled by gooseberries.<br/>
Slash and burn feeds a coming year’s crop of blueberries.<br/>
The forest thrives on waste. Dark wings flutter.<br/>
A red-headed woodpecker knocks<br/>
on the houses of the dead and pulls the worms out.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
The center was never a destination.<br/>
Inside the fallen trunks are roads — circles around circles.<br/>
Insects in the canyons of bark travel with their bundles,<br/>
fall into the dark rooms of the camber,<br/>
get caught in rivers of sap turning to amber.<br/>
Anchored in the rot where so much thrives —<br/>
lichen reaches up to sketch on the rocks.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A catbird hidden in the branches<br/>
whistles and squeaks and whines and mews.<br/>
A catbird says whatever it hears.<br/>
Short notes turn into phrases, are repeated.<br/>
She can see over the Divide a river of clouds.<br/>
She can hear underground, in the rivers that scour the drifts,<br/>
a moneyed sound.<br/>

^<br/>
Buried in the earth, held by frost<br/>
warmed by the sun<br/>
are four wave-worn stones.<br/>
</p><p>
Each is an egg<br/>
that will never hatch.<br/>
Each is a has been.<br/>
Each is yet to be.<br/>
Each has been delivered.<br/>
Each has been born of mineral<br/>
born of fire<br/>
born of pressure.<br/>
</p><p>
The shore has washed<br/>
our tracks,<br/>
wiped each day.<br/>
The shore has no memory<br/>
only stones.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the sound of water<br/>
I remember<br/>
all the launches we made,<br/>
the landings.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember my mother’s morning task,<br/>
the wash.<br/>
Her waves in a machine,<br/>
the swish and flap of wet<br/>
clothes she wrung<br/>
and hung on lines,<br/>
small stones beneath her feet.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember a trip to the cold lake.<br/>
We slipped on stones and waded in,<br/>
skipped flat stones across<br/>
the surface and swam.<br/>
Cold water behind the ear drum<br/>
trickled from our ears.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember the bridge<br/>
over the bay,<br/>
the beach where<br/>
we laid in the sun.<br/>
</p><p>
In the sauna, fire roared<br/>
in the stove<br/>
and heated the round stones.<br/>
We sweated<br/>
threw more water<br/>
that hissed back with steam.<br/>
Laid cold cloths on our faces.<br/>
Cooled our naked bodies<br/>
with buckets of cold lake water<br/>
rubbed our peach skin<br/>
with rough towels.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember betrothals<br/>
and births<br/>
the baptisms.<br/>
The paddle splash and canoe that<br/>
broke the waves.<br/>
</p><p>
Over the sound of waves<br/>
was the sound of birds.<br/>
</p><p>
The shore comes up<br/>
all the time.<br/>
The wind has fallen to nothing.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
These stones are time in my hands.<br/>
They have been broken by ice.<br/>
They’ve been in an ocean’s<br/>
embrace and know<br/>
the motion that falls and rises.<br/>
</p><p>
Stones ride the drift.<br/>
Continents fold.<br/>
Stones are born of weight.<br/>
</p><p>
They remember tectonic plates<br/>
the asteroid and endless winter.<br/>
</p><p>
A stone can hold even<br/>
a bird’s tracks. Memory<br/>
momentary and heavy.<br/>
</p><p>
Each leaves a trace.<br/>
</p><p>
The ocean knows the wind’s hand<br/>
and wind knows<br/>
how it can be driven wild by fire.<br/>
The stones roll in the sea<br/>
that rolls and rolls.<br/>
</p><p>
Edges join. The stones round<br/>
each other.<br/>
Seagulls shriek.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Each stone’s weight<br/>
isn’t always its center.<br/>
Each stone feels my hand like a wave.<br/>
I stack four in the wind<br/>
as if to say, stones have a body.<br/>
A body who won’t stay.<br/>

I was born into another language, my mother’s tongue,<br/>
shore to sapphire and stones, music of accordions,<br/>
tailgate parties, and night-time arguments.<br/>
</p><p>
Instead of beginning, expect hidden sources,<br/>
underground springs. A brogue, a Finnish tongue.<br/>
I slept in her silences, in the sound of falling water,<br/>
</p><p>
learned to swim by drowning.<br/>
I poured sentences into waves that rose into crests and broke,<br/>
rolled my r’s like surf and swallowed the mist, toxic waste,<br/>
</p><p>
green organic matter.<br/>
This is where I wade, oblivious to the drop-off.<br/>
Pebbles ground down to syllables and vowels.<br/>
</p><p>
All the same, according to the river, erosion and accretion,<br/>
migration and digression.<br/>
Now is the river and now and now it’s losing ground.<br/>
</p><p>
Nothing stops here. And her, she bewilders.<br/>
Wilder for a moment, then idler. Ice or vapor.<br/>
In shallows or in the deep, meanders.<br/>
</p><p>
Asleep in the river, a channel open<br/>
goes through violence and its after-wash,<br/>
through silence and sibilance and distant acquaintance,<br/>
</p><p>
a place to join instead of begin, a place of apprehension,<br/>
of tension, of fluid dynamics, all her saying now<br/>
under water’s music.<br/>

Grandmother poured a shot of brandy into her coffee. 
<i>Puna</i>, she called it. 
Always an apron and black shoes with thick heels and thin laces. 
The liquor bottle in the kitchen cabinet, top shelf, on the Iron Range. 
My grandfather was already gone. 
In several directions. 
They migrated from Finland and I was lost in their language. 
Years later, I learned puna meant red. 
I learned the word for river, <i>joki</i>, 
sounding like yoke key.
</p><p>
^<br/>
The pendulum clock knocks in the night and strikes the hours with small bells. 
The chrome kitchen table and yellow Naugahyde chairs listened to the empty rooms, pale green and the carpet, deep green. 
On the wall, a pastoral: cows heading toward a barn and a horse-drawn wagon on a road, never arriving. 
Nearby are silhouettes, framed, and a family portrait with my grandfather at the center, passed out near a kerosene stove below a ceiling vent. 
A television connected to an antenna. 
Behind its convex glass, interference.
</p><p>
^<br/>
When my mother was small, there were ten children in a two-bedroom house. 
Too many mouths, not enough hands. 
Shadows with a long reach. 
In the hallway, a Singer sewing machine, a pincushion, a basket of unfinished business, wool scraps to make a weighty blanket for the bed. 
Don’t think about the past, my mother said. 
I was not released. 
In the kitchen, she stood at a white porcelain sink with cold water only. 
It drained into a slop bucket behind a white curtain. 
One must remember to take the bucket out. 
To wind the clock. 
To keep the pantry door open so it wouldn’t freeze. 
To leave things out.
</p><p>
^<br/>
No doors inside the house, just curtains with cabbage roses, maroon and pink. 
Outside the window, a view of clotheslines. 
In Toivola, the place that meant beautiful, she had an outhouse, a swamp full of tadpoles, and horseflies. 
Inside, a record player, a stack of 78s and 45s, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline. 
All the children left home early. 
Crickets. 
Grasshoppers. 
Cats.
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the barn, the hay slid into the stalls and hooves knocked on the barn floor. 
I saw brown bottles of beer and cows’ tails tied up with binder twine. 
This is where the bullets landed. 
Not in the flesh, only in the wood. If that was his aim. 
Acres of muskeg. 
The story was told but not to me. 
I heard whispers. 
It was over my head, and I couldn’t swim. 
Nights of lighted tobacco smoke and accordions. 
On the instruments, bellow clips and register switches. 
Inside, reeds and wax. 
</p><p>
^<br/>
Outside, push and pull. 
I realize the way my eyes deceive me. 
I went back, walked on the same ground, looked to the other country, the places where my grandmother left. 
Why did she leave? Why did she stay? I heard hands playing the instruments, and the sound of falling water. 
The swish of taffeta slips over secrets. 
The feet that said, <i>Unohda!</i> Forget it. 
The heels said, <i>Ei kestä!</i> Don’t mention it.

spider webs stretch.<br/>
Outside, frost and snow travel like snakes<br/>

^<br/>
In the orchestra, the conductor lifts his arm<br/>
reeds and muscles trade<br/>
</p><p>
with trembling strings.<br/>
The earth tilts a fraction of a degree.<br/>
</p><p>
Cymbals are struck, the sound un-leveling.<br/>
Horses gallop on distant pastures.<br/>
</p><p>
Hollows fill with water. The musicians sweat.<br/>
Flashes of silver and black. Burnished brass.<br/>
</p><p>
An ear for repercussions. The heartbeat of hooves.<br/>
Pearl moon on hot leather.<br/>
</p><p>
This body cannot contain its liberations,<br/>
nor the fire its sparks.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Before the interment, we set the horses free.<br/>
They crossed the empty field<br/>
through shadow and made a path to the burial.<br/>
</p><p>
They gathered behind us.<br/>
The ground split with the weight of a man<br/>
and water filled the hollow.<br/>
</p><p>
I felt the shovel in my chest.<br/>
We placed the young man’s ashes, placed fallen feathers<br/>
into the underground river,<br/>
</p><p>
left notes. Words were taken, the soul<br/>
began to travel. The horses<br/>
retreated as if the last gate closed in their faces.<br/>
</p><p>
The weight is heavy.<br/>
I know the horses will return.<br/>
Eventually will go over, break free.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
At the funeral feast we push back our chairs.<br/>
In the ragged hymn, there’s the clang of plates,<br/>
a hundred horses, racing.<br/>
</p><p>
The body with its headache.<br/>
The body of the horse rises with its slopes<br/>
and glorious veins, dilating<br/>
</p><p>
into a poetry of silence. Of mares.<br/>
Meanwhile, a boat founders<br/>
in a hurricane beyond rescue.<br/>
</p><p>
Cries are heard behind glass.<br/>
Heat has risen, and there is need for<br/>
what will surely never come.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Horses roll into the capillaries<br/>
and follow the conductor<br/>
from the concert hall to other listening walls.<br/>
Blooded, going forward,<br/>
</p><p>
at the pace of heartbeats.<br/>
Never for the last time, ice with vodka<br/>
and cranberry and lime,<br/>
blankets wet and steaming.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A circle of quarter horses with braided manes<br/>
on diamonds, they prance<br/>
with iron shoes<br/>
</p><p>
on roads filled with strife.<br/>
On a dark night, a strike.<br/>
The sound of collapse:<br/>
</p><p>
one great wall and a country on its continent.<br/>
An opera in the house<br/>
and a crisis in the measures.<br/>
</p><p>
The circle runs through graves and their instruments<br/>
through Sibelius’ latitudes<br/>
the hands that held the reins.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In horsepower, the soloist excels,<br/>
her fragile body<br/>
given over to the red violin.<br/>
</p><p>
She’s a racehorse. Ears back, ears forward.<br/>
In chaos and howling war,<br/>
the motion of flanks and haunches.<br/>
</p><p>
We can’t hear our own voices.<br/>
We can’t tune it out.<br/>
Heedless riders, in the ebb of sound.<br/>
</p><p>
Hay in the loft spontaneously combusted.<br/>
The staves burnt in a white heat.<br/>
When the wind dropped, we fell.<br/>
Got up again. Shoulders in.<br/>

I add it to the dark rags for my loom<br/>

add rock corings and depths of the great lake<br/>

I ride rails between hills that are mine dumps,<br/>

Minntac.<br/>

In the pit, giant dump trucks<br/>
haul tons of rock to the Crusher.<br/>

Laborers in the Agglomerator<br/>
breathe black dust.<br/>

The furnace vents fill with hot pellets<br/>
have to be emptied into the buckets<br/>
of front end loaders by maintenance laborers<br/>
wearing asbestos suits.<br/>

White pellets were 1000 degrees Fahrenheit<br/>
black were 400 degrees.<br/>
Pellets could stick to the skin, burn into the neck.<br/>
It was called a Minntac brand.<br/>

One day, I saw a front-end loader<br/>
roll over the foot of a laborer.<br/>

teetered over the edge. Clung to the wires.<br/>
Down the hill, the sumps could not pump and<br/>
water rose in the basements.<br/>
</p><p>
High water scoured the banks, moved boulders, uprooted<br/>
lifted old pines into arms of the younger.<br/>
Rails of bridges caught tree trunks.<br/>
Bridge decks got knocked off the pylons.<br/>

Neighbors went out to stare at what was no longer there.<br/>
A car was parked. The ground beneath it sunk six feet.<br/>
Brewer’s Creek, buried years ago, burst<br/>
through the macadam and removed the grocery parking lot.<br/>

At the zoo, seals washed away. The polar bear<br/>
escaped its cage and walked through the alley.<br/>
In the cemetery, graves lost their names<br/>
and unburied the coffins.<br/>

In the west a child swept into a storm drain<br/>
came out alive.<br/>

On the thawing ground, I found<br/>
a robin’s nest,<br/>
a coil of mud and dry grass<br/>
woven around a single chamber.<br/>
</p><p>
I’ve worked like this<br/>
for the same result<br/>
something of my own disappearing.<br/>
</p><p>
My own child, grown and flown.<br/>
My old houses, abandoned,<br/>
the love sputtered out.<br/>
</p><p>
Every year, I enter the forest<br/>
and pick up broken shells<br/>
or the skull of a deer.<br/>
And now this, a drab and hollow nest.<br/>
</p><p>
When the robins return, they will build<br/>
a new work of art<br/>
only to be discarded again.<br/>
They will march across the yard and guard<br/>
</p><p>
that space. Will sing.<br/>
I must put it on my sill, to remember<br/>
in next year’s unfamiliar spring:<br/>
how empty is the natal place.<br/>

Before the earth, in the <i>Kalevala</i>,<br/>
a virgin of the air Ilmatar<br/>
wandered the high altitudes<br/>
with time on her hands.<br/>
</p><p>
The ocean lured her in.<br/>
She slapped the water, flirted<br/>
with wind and the wind dared<br/>
or the waves slid along her thighs<br/>
quickened in her empty womb —<br/>
</p><p>
she swam seven hundred years<br/>
with salt upon her tongue.<br/>
In solitude. A child within.<br/>
</p><p>
She heard a lonesome note in the sky,<br/>
some winged thing<br/>
searching for a land to build a nest.<br/>
In reply, lifted her knee, an island.<br/>
The hen came to nest<br/>
laid seven eggs. One was iron.<br/>
</p><p>
The hen set to brooding.<br/>
The nest so hot<br/>
Ilmatar in the indigo deep<br/>
couldn’t keep still<br/>
twitched like an earthquake<br/>
and the eggs all broke.<br/>
</p><p>
One half shell formed dry earth<br/>
Terra, and the other half<br/>
the aqua vault.<br/>
One yolk became sun<br/>
and albumen, clouds<br/>
and the Milky Way.<br/>
</p><p>
The litter of shells<br/>
veins of iron and copper.<br/>
Ilmatar moved clay<br/>
beneath her feet to make reefs<br/>
and deeps for a silver cloud of herring<br/>
and icebergs calving.<br/>
</p><p>
Made the headlands<br/>
and mountains to hold up the sky<br/>
Unfolded the continents<br/>
drew out the rivers.<br/>
</p><p>
This is how Ilmatar’s labor began.<br/>
Exertion became a waterfall.<br/>
From her moon’s chamber<br/>
through the bony gate<br/>
she gave birth to a singer,<br/>
an earth diver.<br/>
</p><p>
Named him Väinämöinen.<br/>
Already he was an old man.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Winds rippled through grain fields<br/>
and swayed the dense forests.<br/>
</p><p>
The singer plucked at strands<br/>
on the jawbone of a fish,<br/>
<i>hän lauloi laulun</i>.<br/>
<i>Laulaa taivanrannalle</i>,<br/>
to sing to the sky’s beach.<br/>
</p><p>
Loud migrations darkened the sky.<br/>
</p><p>
In the waves were multitudes.<br/>

Radio signals wandered. The road a dark avenue north<br/>
through Seven Mile Swamp and the crossings of deer.<br/>
Our union went by land and water, under the stars, our truck<br/>
pulling a boat and motor in a blizzard of moths.<br/>
</p><p>
To live by the mine and not mine. To store, not excavate.<br/>
In the winter, to hunt rabbits and partridge,<br/>
leap and burst and flight.<br/>
To climb into the stand for the annual buck.<br/>
See how the body smooths the rough bark of the tree.<br/>
</p><p>
To hunt moose. Gut and quarter the body. Fry moose liver<br/>
in a cast iron pan, in onions. Sew a jacket from its hide<br/>
on a shoemaker’s treadle machine. Trim the hood<br/>
with wolfskin and line it with goose down.<br/>
</p><p>
To form a small country, population two.<br/>
Carry water. Between killing frosts, plant flats of tomatoes<br/>
and can rows of red innards, tomato hearts<br/>
in wide-mouthed jars. Rows of deer meat, in gravy,<br/>
sealed in a pressure cooker.<br/>
</p><p>
To pick berries. Chop wood. Ignore the years between us.<br/>
In the spring opener, accustom ourselves to the rocking<br/>
of the boat in wave after wave. To anchor in the cold,<br/>
holding lines. At New Year’s, turn a hand auger<br/>
and make a hole in the ice.<br/>
</p><p>
To jig for lake trout in a polar vortex,<br/>
the day bright with sundogs. Camp on the ice.<br/>
Warm our tent with a stove. Bale water from the floor.<br/>
To sleep at forty below zero. Hear the lake making ice,<br/>
a sound like thunder, except from beneath.<br/>
</p><p>
To find our melting point. Our boiling point.<br/>
To smoke trout. Wrap in butcher paper.<br/>
Set a table with the prize fish<br/>
served with cream cheese and slices of cucumber.<br/>
Drink vodka. Heat the pie<br/>
in the wood stove and eat.<br/>
</p><p>
Anything could be fixed, a propeller caught in the weeds,<br/>
the boat grounded on a reef or a broken leg.<br/>
Staples worked themselves through the skin after many years.<br/>
He moved the course of a small river. A forest was making<br/>
and unmaking.<br/>
</p><p>
We measured the old pines, built a house and dock<br/>
in another country. Made a child.<br/>
I can’t own this, not even the words.<br/>
In May, my mother tied a scarf at her nape<br/>
and played a game of chance. Didn’t win.<br/>
</p><p>
Life runs on whim and temper.<br/>
On this red morning, through sweeping balsam<br/>
comes the deer to the bird feeder.<br/>
The sunflowers grew fast and spent their seeds.<br/>
Our stake melted like snow. We thought it would last,<br/>
but Canadian geese contradicted us flying overhead.

</header><p>
Balsams tapped my sleeves as I tramped into corridors<br/>
through the mind of the forest that owns me.<br/>
In its gaze, the trunks were not trunks but masts.<br/>
</p><p>
They were beams of an infinite pavilion with a floor<br/>
not level but built on the slopes and troughs of a wave.<br/>
The snow was not blue as the sky, but sifted, drifted<br/>
</p><p>
from that hue, not blue as the lake but lifted like vapor.<br/>
Or as from stars, although misted and dusted.<br/>
In the machinery of wind in the rolling cloud of forest<br/>
</p><p>
I could feel the land lift and drop.<br/>
A branch broke its tip, scented me with pitch.<br/>
I put my weight on a city of fungus.<br/>
</p><p>
In the clearing, close to the frozen cataract of the pond<br/>
gray as wasps’ nests among the vertical lines<br/>
wolves spoke from their shoreless territories<br/>
</p><p>
a song of lament and rejoicing. Things repeat, rhyme,<br/>
underline. Words spoken aloud have a vibration that travels<br/>
around the earth in the wind overhead.<br/>
</p><p>
I went past tree stumps sharpened like spears near<br/>
the ice-latched beaver lodge and its exhalations<br/>
through fallen rooms of light.<br/>
</p><p>
Under the layers of years, there was once a farm here<br/>
a cultivated field. There were children, arguments,<br/>
and convictions replaced by seedlings that turned into trees<br/>
</p><p>
and trees kept propagating even among the dead.<br/>
I met those without roots, those that levitate,<br/>
those that break as much as bend and hang on nothing.<br/>
</p><p>
I heard the bark of trees being printed and bound,<br/>
saw the mark of claws on a trunk and piercing by beaks.<br/>
In the eaves of spruce trees<br/>
</p><p>
crows hung their capes. A Medusa reared, roots<br/>
pulled up by counterweight. From the ground<br/>
a boulder crested. Above, an owl sat motionless, seeing<br/>
</p><p>
all that was hidden and nameless.<br/>
I passed an open grave ribboned by shade<br/>
and stepped through the vapor of sleep into a wild bed.<br/>

I heard the rub of reins, the jingle of a halter<br/>
the groan of the saddle.<br/>

Smelled the dusty wool saddle blanket,<br/>
the horse’s flanks and mane and tail.<br/>

From the road, I noticed<br/>
a green shaggy bear.<br/>
Coming closer, it turned into windfall<br/>
from a storm,<br/>
a wheel of roots pulled from the ground<br/>
propped next to a fallen trunk,<br/>
both grown over and thick with moss<br/>
that grows on the living and the dead,<br/>
takes everything back to silence.<br/>
</p><p>
I was deep in that silence<br/>
when I noticed a spruce tree<br/>
with a broken top,<br/>
resembling a headless giant, a woman,<br/>
a pillar of the earth.<br/>
Boughs were arranged like a skirt<br/>
on her long torso.<br/>
Full of wind’s motion, striding.<br/>

In the night I heard a voice crying or laughing.<br/>
In Finland. I had just arrived —<br/>
pulled up the window blind<br/>
on heavy rain and saw a beam of light<br/>
that stroked the wind-lashed tree.<br/>
</p><p>
The person holding the flashlight, unseen,<br/>
speaking in the other language.<br/>
I picked up my phone to see<br/>
3:03 a.m. and a news alert.<br/>
Terrorists attacked Bataclan in Paris.<br/>
</p><p>
That day, I remembered seeing<br/>
a long line of military vehicles, dark green<br/>
with camouflage over their loads<br/>
going through town. Assumed this was routine.<br/>
Remembered my mother Siiri.<br/>
</p><p>
She prized the one-way ticket<br/>
to the new country.<br/>
If I even mentioned a desire to see<br/>
where my grandparents were born,<br/>
she became frantic, as if under siege.<br/>
</p><p>
What if a war breaks out?<br/>
If you can’t get back? Then what?<br/>
Civil strife, the Winter War,<br/>
World War I and II,<br/>
the Russian interventions in Eastern Europe.<br/>
Her evidence.<br/>
</p><p>
Thirty years later — I listen<br/>
to what I don’t understand.<br/>
How long it had taken me to come!<br/>

Summer on the river in Zim<br/>
beneath the bridge.<br/>
Three girls swam in the currents.<br/>
We left our towels<br/>
on the steep bank in the long grass.<br/>
The water, dark as amber<br/>
or tea. It was cold. Spring fed.<br/>
We could cross from one side<br/>
to the other. We could<br/>
step in the drop-off, not drown.<br/>
Cows grazing upon the ridge<br/>
kept an eye on us.<br/>
Then a bell rang and they went<br/>
across the field into the barn<br/>
which used to be the Woullet house.<br/>
The cows were in the old kitchen.<br/>
We never knew the Woullets —<br/>
didn’t know the past at all<br/>
although it cast us out of its door.<br/>
Now hooves scraped<br/>
floors once washed clean.<br/>
Manure was piled high<br/>
outside the door<br/>
beside yellow dandelions.<br/>
The cows chewed their cud<br/>
and looked out the windows<br/>
at the evening light,<br/>
while my uncle tied their tails<br/>
with binder twine before milking.<br/>
We salted our toes<br/>
to make the blood-suckers let go.<br/>
We put our shoes back on wet feet<br/>
to walk over the new mown hay.<br/>
We climbed over the log gate<br/>
and ran toward a new house.<br/>
I’ve come to know that freedom now.<br/>
It winds across the landscape<br/>
calling like girls’ voices.<br/>

Pine trees grown fifty feet.<br/>
Cedars thick and green. I did not sleep.<br/>

the clerk dropped change in our palms<br/>
and we split the Sacajawea coins.<br/>
Two women, two dollars each.<br/>
Liberty was emblazoned over her head<br/>

daylight fell on the mountains and valleys<br/>

and we were behind glass<br/>
looking out to Lake Superior<br/>
steam rising from the hot tub.<br/>
We fed each other slices of oranges<br/>
and focaccia pierced by<br/>
small arrows of rosemary.<br/>
The flying-by clouds propelled the wind<br/>
that circled the earth and came back again.<br/>
We were in a river that could not stop.<br/>
I rubbed the coins for luck<br/>
and the woman whose face I touched<br/>
led us onward,<br/>
explorers of the light,<br/>
not taking land<br/>
not trading in counterfeits.<br/>
We came up for breath on the river delta.<br/>
This was not luck but legal tender.<br/>

Fog ascends and descends on broken ladders<br/>
in sun’s fire. Under the surface, collapsing architectures.<br/>
</p><p>
A sunken ribcage. Bubbles from the deep.<br/>
In the uncharted cave, twisting and glacial corridors<br/>
</p><p>
inhabited by shadows. Unknown spawnings,<br/>
suspensions and ripples of predators.<br/>
</p><p>
Below the horizon. On the surface, laughter.<br/>
On the surface, tension. A slow churn of trawlers.<br/>
</p><p>
Fire in the distance. Sparks rise<br/>
and the clouds climb and dive like otters.<br/>
</p><p>
In the place between chords, afloat.<br/>
Four strings of the cello, drifting registers.<br/>
</p><p>
The decrescendo of the dock and anchors<br/>
the sway of the crib and its timbres.<br/>
</p><p>
Flashes of lightning horizontal and vertical.<br/>
Bluebottles water-logged. The visible arterial.<br/>
</p><p>
An aquasphere of planes, volumes, parallel lines,<br/>
rhythms through dark matter.<br/>

In the forest, where the river breaks free<br/>
we sleep in the resonant room back-to-back<br/>
close to the cello that sways on the night sea,<br/>
an ancient boat whose chamber empties perpetually.<br/>
</p><p>
Your hand trembles on the bedsheet in sleep<br/>
the thick callouses and grooves on the fingertips<br/>
remember each quicksilver string. The force you have<br/>
to plunge your bow into the invisible<br/>
</p><p>
and drive an arrow of notes in the air.<br/>
How not known, never known, the instrument’s dreams.<br/>
The tumble into the great falls, the rush of the body<br/>
over the edge on the jagged earth<br/>
</p><p>
so deep. We resurface and look for each other<br/>
reach for – a breath, a handhold<br/>
the unwritten score etched on each of your palms<br/>
where forces circle and improvise.<br/>
</p><p>
The moon shines on its shelf and the river goes<br/>
and cello composes its grief<br/>
on parallel wires bound by night hours<br/>
rising in upward flights.<br/>

I woke to an acre of mayflies<br/>
a lace of water lilies and weeds<br/>
before and after<br/>
nudges of waves<br/>
coming to and from the island<br/>
a cloud on the water, thick pollen afloat<br/>
and lines crossing.<br/>
Having slept beneath stars<br/>
I overestimated depths<br/>
and underestimated distances.<br/>
Underwater, a flash<br/>
of brown and silver walleyes.<br/>
The shore’s edge a mix of tenses<br/>
and mosquitoes chased by dragonflies.<br/>
Ducks swim over the wakes<br/>

</header><p>
I was born into two languages, born of two families who came from western Finland across the Baltic and Atlantic to settle in Minnesota. My grandparents’ language, my parents’ first language, became waves. Their words sank beneath the surface as I entered my adult life, but the music of their language rose in me.</p>
<p>Finnish requires a different placement of the tongue and a different way to hold the mouth. In Finnish the word for lake is <i>järvi</i>. The j is pronounced as y in English. The ä indicates a short vowel sound, like in the word hand. An r is always rolled. The i is pronounced as a long e. The Finnish language is imagistic and close to nature. <i>Taivaanranta</i>, for instance, translates to <i>sky’s beach</i>. The Finnish language uses noun endings instead of prepositional phrases. For example, the Finnish word <i>vene</i> which means <i>boat</i> undergoes numerous transformations which might mean going to the boat, coming from it, being inside the boat or being outside of it. The suffix, the end of the word, conveys necessary information. In a sentence, Finnish words undergo systematic consonant changes, vowel harmonies, harmonic suffixes and rhythms that reach a dimension of melody. This music rolled like a river through my childhood.</p>
<p>^<br/>
Northern Minnesota has many lakes and rivers. As we were bringing the boats to paddle on Stewart Lake, a helicopter lifted a red bucket over the trees and went north, carrying water to the Greenwood wildfire, burning through 40 square miles. Beyond, in the Boundary Waters, were two more fires, the John Ek fire and Whelp Fire. The air was hazy with smoke. On the water, I was in my blue kayak and my paddling partner in her red one. We approached our landmark rock. Because of the low water levels, the boulder sat much higher above the surface than usual, just like the islands. The wind was intense. We went along the east side and then returned to shore as another helicopter with a red bucket flew north. I see it now as if from a distance. The red bucket under the helicopter had the orb shape of an eye, and it was swaying with sloshing water. As I looked, the image seemed to expand and contract, the way things magnify and shrink underwater.</p>
<p>Home from kayaking later that day, I noticed a black spot in the upper corner of my vision in my left eye. In brightly lit rooms, it was hardly noticeable. When I walked into a darkened room, the spot flipped over like a tadpole. I noticed more floaters, a long black fiber that was like a bit of grass or spider’s web located between my eye and the objects that I could see, revealing a third dimension that I had not realized existed.</p>
<p>Two days later, the doctor who examined my vision diagnosed a posterior vitreous detachment. The vitreous, which starts out being like jello when one is young, thins out with age. What I was seeing, he explained, is called flashing. It is caused by the vitreous tugging on the retina. He added that the floaters might move to the center of my vision. You’ll get used to it, he assured. The brain adjusts and you won’t notice anymore. He went on talking about the anatomy of the eye, but I was thinking one of those floaters looked like a taconite fiber.</p>
<p>^<br/>
When one buys a blue boat, it seems one sees a lot of blue boats. This could be a law about synchronicity in the universe or this could be that noticing is a habit of the mind. A friend observed something about this manuscript: it’s underwater. Not only under but over and through. It’s about water and volume displacing other volumes.</p>
<p>These poems travel through migration, mining excavations and waterways vulnerable to environmental damage and climate change in Minnesota, where the Northern Continental Divide crosses the Laurentian Divide and creates three watersheds that flow into the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, and Hudson Bay. These are stories and images, historical and contemporary, about people who are displaced, whose languages are replaced by another language, and who find a fluid space full of gaps, silence, and risk. The book has gone through numerous changes, and it has even turned over, like lakes turn over. The bottom has risen to the top and the surface has sunk.</p>
<p>A manuscript in progress stays fluid for a long time. This project began while I was at Arteles, an artists’ retreat in Hameenkyrö, Finland. Besides my grandparents, I thought of current immigrants. I thought of the many people who are displaced by climate change and violence. Immigrants navigate huge changes in landscape, language, and culture. Often, they overcome these barriers without many or any resources. The Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration near the Statute of Liberty displays old posters expressing the resentments against immigrants. Although points of origin have changed, attitudes have not. Because of fear of this judgment, my mother tried to extinguish her Finnish accent.</p>
<p>The book is also about other surface displacements, the mining excavations in my landscape. The Mesabi Iron Range is an area 3 miles wide and 120 miles long, a water-rich landscape and an industrial one. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 4.1 billion tons of ore and taconite have been shipped away. Already mining has permanently altered the three-way divide and the path of flowing water.</p>
<p>Thomas F. Waters, author of <i>The Free-Flowing River</i>, says rivers are erosional landscapes. As a river flows forward in a valley and carves itself deeper, the valley travels backward. As a river flows forward, its waterfalls move backward. It isn’t just the edges or banks of the river that erode, but also the river bottom. There are forces in the landscape that pull in opposite directions, much like forces in our culture.</p>
<p>^<br/>
First, tribal nations inhabited the region of what is now Minnesota. Lake Esquagama, where I grew up, was an important location early in history. According to historian Marvin Lamppa, the burial mounds around Esquagama, which date back to the year 1000 A.D., were made by the Woodland Indians. Not much is known about their culture. Near the mounds, arrowheads have been found and copper implements made from the copper deposits in the area. Other tribes came after the Woodland people. As the United States population grew and settlers and immigrants moved westward, the eastern tribes were pushed west as well. The Anishinaabe people came to Minnesota in the mid-1800s, and with them, the vision of food that grows on water, Manoomin or wild rice. The Iron Range is where my grandparents arrived in the early 1900s, along with hundreds of thousands of other immigrants. When they came, over forty languages were spoken on the Iron Range. No other region was as diverse except for New York City.</p>
<p>The past is underwater somehow, sunken and like Atlantis. Maybe the past lacks oxygen, but I have been diving into the wreck, as Adrienne Rich said in her famous poem. I have been inspired by Meridel Le Sueur’s words, “Let yourself down, as if underwater, into these lost walls, to hunt for treasure, to illuminate violence with meaning. Under sea-strange light these little houses glimmer in memory, powerful as radium.” Under the surface are hidden worlds. Things float away, and things wash up.</p>
<p>^<br/>
When I was in college I worked as a maintenance laborer at Minntac in Mountain Iron, a summer job. It was 1975. It paid well. I was in the Agglomerator where four monstrous furnaces rolled taconite fines and bentonite into pellets. The machinery in the taconite plant is larger than the human scale. Each furnace was the size of a train engine and as noisy. Laborers wore earplugs, yellow hard hats, fitted goggles, steel-toed boots, and coveralls. I was in an alienated workforce. That summer, the millwrights went out on a wildcat strike, unauthorized by the union. These workers wanted the same wages as their counterparts in the steel mills. Most of the laborers honored their picket line and did not go to work. Steel imports were coming from Brazil into the United States for the first time, increasing the competition and driving down the price. Within a few weeks, the strike was broken. The corporation sued the workers for lost profits, and they gave in and returned to the plant without having made any gains.</p>
<p>My father had instilled in me a sense of solidarity. Never cross a picket line, he said. I didn’t. When the strike was called off, I went back to work. Most shifts, I aimed a high-pressure water hose at the taconite pellets that had fallen off the conveyors to the floor of the plant. By washing down the floor, we were able to prevent a build-up that could stop the conveyor from functioning. Sometimes, there were extra chores. When the furnaces were shut down, and after they had spent some days cooling, we would push wheelbarrows inside the cylindrical interiors and shovel out broken bricks. Other times, on the floor of the plant, we emptied hot pellets from the vent pipes from the furnaces. Red pellets, like live coals, were 1000 degrees, and black pellets, 400 degrees. The vents weren’t supposed to accumulate hot pellets, but they did. We had thick asbestos suits and gloves for the task. We opened the door at the bottom of the vent pipe and let the pellets fall out into the bucket of a front-end loader, which would turn and dump them onto a conveyor going out to the loading dock. My coworkers suggested wearing a bandanna around the neck to protect myself from the hot pellets raining down through the catwalks from the upper floors. If a pellet fell into the collar, it would stick in the flesh and cause the skin to bubble and melt. Workers called the burn mark a Minntac brand.</p>
<p>Workers all breathed in the dust of the plant. At the time, we weren’t aware that taconite fibers are similar to asbestos fibers. Now, it’s known that employees of the taconite mine run a higher risk of contracting mesothelioma. When Meridel Le Sueur was a young writer, radium was thought to be a miraculous element. It was used in cosmetics, toothpaste, and cancer treatments. It was painted on watch dials, poisoning factory workers. Only later was radium determined to be carcinogenic.</p>
<p>We were submerged. The furnaces and conveyors were noisy and created their own wind. The Agglomerator had no windows, and it was hot. The paperback books I tucked in my lunch pail curled up stiff as fallen leaves, darkened by heat and whatever was in the air. After every shift, I showered in the “dry” and though I’d soaped and rinsed thoroughly, I toweled taconite dust from my nostrils and the folds of my ears and behind my knees. Grease and dust stained my coveralls and my underwear. Once the whistle blew ending the shift, men drove to the bars and poured beer down their throats. They blacked out, and in oblivion, after the bars closed, drove erratically on side roads to one of the many lakes, chains of lakes, or to the sinuous St Louis River. Some went skinny-dipping, some hooked up with partners they couldn’t later remember, and some collided with unmovable objects. Off-limits were the tailings ponds and the abandoned mine pits, steep-walled and filled with ice-cold water, cast-off mechanical equipment, and other unknown hazards.</p>
<p>Mining excavations always need tending, even after the supply of ore is gone. The abandoned open pits suffer “water gain” because of the high-water tables and rain. Pumps must be kept running to avoid flooding. The Hector Mine on the Iron Range operated from 1893 to 1953. In 2019, after a heavy rain, the embankment between the old Hector mine pit and the Embarrass River burst. The water from the mine pit tore a ravine 50 feet wide and 25 feet deep. A burnt orange torrent, the color of iron oxidation, poured into the river and went downstream into the Embarrass Lake, Cedar Island Lake, and Lake Esquagama. Septic systems broke and raw sewage was released. Workers needed to remove rocks and gravel to reopen the stream so it could flow again. Even before this, the lakes and rivers had been proven to have high sulfate levels which largely comes from taconite mines in discharge from waste storage. Sulfates cause Manoomin or wild rice to die, eliminating this sacred source of nutrition and sustenance. The Hector Mine spill made things worse.</p>
<p>With its many lakes, streams, and swamps, the Iron Range is adjacent to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, a wilderness designated by the federal government. Some want to develop copper sulfide mining near the BWCA even though surface storage of waste rock, tailings and copper sulfide-bearing ore creates acid, heavy metals, and sulfates that seep into groundwater and contaminate lakes, streams and rivers. In this region with a three-way continental divide, contamination puts all forms of life at risk.</p>
<p>^<br/>
There’s so much weight. Changes are happening every moment. There are unknowns, and there are known things deliberately disregarded or dismissed. Events in the past are often forgotten. Union-busting, strikes, sabotage, and murders are hidden under a shroud of silence. Data about mining accidents and environmental contamination exists, but it isn’t general knowledge.</p>
<p>History documents that treaties made with the tribal nations were not followed. Silences have obscured the facts. Eminent domain has been misused against the tribes. Buying land in Minnesota does not mean buying the mineral rights beneath the surface. Minnesota owns 24 percent of the mineral rights in the state, but the rest is owned by private parties, primarily mining corporations (Mesabi Metallics, Keetac, Cleveland Cliffs, and others). Minerals are profitable, and corporations prioritize profits over people, and so roads and communities are demolished to make way for excavation. As the landscape or tonnage (as the corporations refer to it) is removed, maps are redrawn. Against the large-scale mining operations, people’s lives begin to diminish.</p>
<p>^<br/>
When the rich iron ore was depleted in northern Minnesota, the underground mines became open-pit mines. Technological developments allowed the industry to use lower-grade ore to make taconite. Now many of the open-pit mines have been depleted. Recently, mine dumps are consumed in what is called scram mining, furthering the metamorphosis of the landscape. When I drive along Highway 169, I see yard signs with the words: We Support Mining, Mining Supports Us. I know, and they know, it’s always been a story of boom and bust.</p>
<p>The darkest place on the Iron Range is the deepest place, the underground mine in Soudan, Minnesota. At Level 27, the shaft is 2,341 feet deep and a perpetual 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The buildings of the mine are situated at one the highest points on the Iron Range, with long views of the forest and surrounding land. The ore from the Soudan mine was exceptionally rich. It was unique and had an extra oxygen molecule in its chemical composition. Along the shaft of the mine are stopes, dugout tunnels that contained the ore that was mined. Without a light, one can’t see a hand in front of the face. The mine is so dark that a physics lab was temporarily created there to study dark matter, things in the universe that cannot be seen at all, but that are known because of their interaction with gravity. Neutrinos were shot from the Fermi lab near Chicago through the earth and recorded by several tons of specialized equipment down in the mine shaft. The absolute darkness in the mine avoided a skew in the research results caused by protons. According the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN), dark matter outweighs visible matter roughly six to one. It travels in next to no time.</p>
<p>^<br/>
In a stream, according to Thomas F. Waters, fish arrange themselves according to the water temperature, width and depth of the water, slope of ground, and pools and riffles over stones. In our streams, fish swim amidst industrial effluences. We can’t let ourselves become so accustomed to this situation that we no longer see it.
</p><p>
People, searching for what feels comfortable, arrange themselves in similar ways. Yet we get displaced, intentionally or not. When it occurs, others might signal that we don’t belong, or we just feel that way ourselves. Displacement can be temporary or permanent. It occurs in large contexts like climate change, war or violence, natural disasters, or other ways. It also occurs in smaller, individual contexts. We live in complex social systems and ecosystems. There are thousands of variables. Change is hard, but it can sharpen our attention and raise our awareness of what is happening in the environment.
</p><p>
Tensions in the landscape are part of the mosaic. It’s all fluid. I’m struck by how often change has wave patterns. A disturbance in one place causes disturbances in other places. Science tells us when waves come into shore, they bounce back: reflection. Waves that slow down and change direction: refraction. When waves bend: diffraction with shadow zones. When waves affect each other: interference, which can be destructive or positive. The Finnish poet Risto Rasa writes: “Just as one wave swims with another wave/ Across the ocean/ We too survive, supporting each other.” My immigrant grandparents had to overcome many obstacles to live, work, and raise a family. Although my mother was born in Minnesota, she was held back in first grade because she did not know enough English. For everybody, change is a set of unpredictable currents that will require endurance, creativity, and connection to a larger community.
</p><p>
In my poems, I want to bring together things that are conflicting, noisy, and beautiful. I want to consider all lives: animal, avian, aquatic, and plant life. The poet Rosmarie Waldrop writes: “When eye and mind are interrupted in the travel, a vertical dimension opens out from the horizontal lines. Suddenly we’re reading an orchestral score…. No longer one single voice.” Attention and vision, both the individual and collective, are gifts that will benefit our communities. The disappearance of trees, wildlife, people, languages, clean water and even geology will leave traces inside the body and not only inside our bodies, but in the body of earth, changing the flow of life.
<p>^<br/>
When I was a child staying overnight in my grandmother’s house, the pendulum clock struck each hour. I would awaken from sleep not knowing what had broken into my dreams. Even now, I am up at night. Occasionally, I will wake with a Finnish word in mind, like <i>hetkessä</i>. It had been spoken at home. It is usually an ordinary word I’ve remembered although I hadn’t understood or had forgotten what it meant. It’s like receiving a letter sent from long ago. It’s a memory that brings me closer to the family members who have passed. I savor the word’s rhythm. Between languages exists a beautiful threshold space, full of nuanced meaning. Like every Finnish word, the stress is on the first syllable. Every letter is pronounced, none are silent. Double consonants are each pronounced, elongating the sound as if it were a note held long, like a dotted quarter note, the dot indicating the need to hold the sound half again as long. I like the quiet of darkness. Outside, moonlight rains on the roads and inside, it washes against a wall. Wind in the tree branches outside makes shadows sway. It’s as if I’d been underwater and suddenly surfaced. Each word, each language, is a musical element, expressive of the intuitions and culture of people who came before. One often finds a word exactly when it is needed. <i>Hetkessä</i> means <i>in next to no time</i>.</p>
<p>^<br/>
Poetry is a language inside the language. In a poem in next to no time, years can collapse. Whole eras can elide into a few lines, or one moment can be forever held still. Poetry has underwater currents or forces. Muriel Rukeyser says “poetry can extend the document” in a footnote to her poems in “The Book of the Dead,” a section of her 1938 book titled <i>U.S. 1</i>. It is about the Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster in Gauley Bridge, West Virginia, which killed at least 476 coal miners, mostly African American migrant workers, between 1930 and 1935. Her poems incorporate archival material about the mining disaster with lyric intensity. The title alludes to the Egyptian Book of the Dead and the Mayan Book of the Dead, evoking the power and weight of those ancient funerary texts. In this way, the form of a poem along with its sound patterns, images, associations, and metaphors can bring together the said and unsaid. On a page, a poem has empty spaces that can be understood like the negative space in a drawing. Stanza breaks might be viewed as bends or turns in a river. Line endings in a poem form a shoreline to launch from and land upon, an empty and wave-washed beach, an edge where we can hold the losses and make new paths, where we search and find things new.

</header><p>In the Water</p>
<p>
“Water-Filled Mine Pit” is an ekphrastic prose poem for the “Mine Songs” music and aerial images created by Sara Pajunen. The poem was also inspired by poet and journalist Meridel Le Sueur: “Let yourself down, as if underwater, into these lost walls, to hunt for treasure, to illuminate violence with meaning. Under sea-strange light these little houses glimmer in memory, powerful as radium.”
</p>
<p>Surface Displacements</p>
<p>
The epigraph by Lorine Niedecker is from her poem, “(L.Z.),” which originated from correspondence with poet Louis Zukofsky.
</p><p>
Three Rivers and the “Surface Displacements” poem refer to the three-way continental divide located in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Iron Range. The watersheds and rivers travel into the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River, and Hudson Bay.
</p><p>
A historical marker at the edge of the Hull-Rust Mahoning mine pit marks the Hill of Three Waters, or the Triple Divide.
According to the Historical Marker Database (<a href="www.hmdb.org">www.hmdb.org</a>):
</p><p>
<blockquote>
A triple point, or triple divide, is the place where two continental divides intersect and water drains into three different watersheds. There are five such places in the United States. In Minnesota, the Northern Divide intersects the St. Lawrence Seaway Divide. From this point, water flows in three directions, north to Hudson Bay, south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This area was called the Hill of Three Waters by the Chippewa, and its location is 47° 26.863′ N, 92° 56.8′ W. The marker is near Hibbing, Minnesota, in St. Louis County. The Chippewa Indians referred to the location as “The Hill of Three Waters” or “The Top of the World” and frequently held their council meetings there for tribes living within about a 100-mile radius. The site is not publicly accessible due to mining operations. Its official platting is Section 26, Township 58, Range 21.
</blockquote>

The Historical Marker Database is a catalog of public history cast in metal, carved on stone, or embedded in resin. The database is maintained by volunteers who invite people to send in photographs and links related to historical markers.
</p><p>
A second historical marker is placed nearby this one at the Hull-Rust Mahoning Mine Pit Overlook. Here the marker notes that mining began in 1895 and this mine pit was once known as the largest open pit mine in the world. Its maximum depth was 600 feet in the Scranton Pit. By 2000, nearly 2 billion tons of iron ore and waste were removed. Both sources note this information is provided in partnership with the Cleveland-Cliffs Foundation. Cleveland-Cliffs is a mining corporation.

“A river catches herself as she is falling” is inspired by the mystic Mechthild von Magdeburg (1207–1282), a Beguine.
</p><p>
“In the city are those who cannot be traced...” is an ekphrastic poem for visual art by Cecilia Ramón. The poem refers to Argentina’s Dirty War (in Spanish, <i>Guerra Sucia</i>), also called <i>Process of National Reorganization, Spanish Proceso de Reorganización Nacional</i>, or <i>El Proceso</i>. As many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared.
</p><p>
“In their wake, the undocumented...” refers to immigrants who are stowaways inside the hold of planes and ships and those who risk perilous passage over water. The phrase also refers to those who are brought across the borders in secret, inside closed freight trucks and vans.

In the prose poem “Soliloquy,” the sentence <i>I realize the way my eyes deceive me</i> echoes a line from the country song “Paper Roses,” written and composed by Fred Spielman and Janice Torre. Loretta Lynn and several other country singers have performed and recorded it.
</p><p>
“Dialectics” is a cento. The italicized phrases are taken from Hegel and Marx, whose writings are now available in the public domain.
</p><p>
“Broken Shell” is a retelling of the creation story in the epic poem of Finland, the <i>Kalevala</i>, that was performed by traveling minstrels or singers prior to being written down by Elias Lönnrot. Some of the runos, or poems, have never been in print. Beside creation stories, it has magic charms, laments, advice, stories, and adventures.

The Finnish language poems were written while I was at Arteles in Hämeenkyrö, Finland, at the Enter Text residency.

According to Veikko Anttonen in <i>Mythic Discourses</i>, in the <i>Kalevala</i>, Pohjola refers to the Otherworld and “can take the form of Pohjola (the northland), the womb, a burial ground, a forest, a grave, Tuonela or Manala (underworld or realm of the dead), a strange village or country.” He also writes: 
</p><p>
<blockquote>
In [Finnish and Uralic] folk narratives, Pohjola is described as a mythic island in the primeval sea, surrounded by open waters. In addition Pohjola is separated from the world of the living by the River of Pohjola, the River of Tuonela, the chasm of Manala, the age-old brook of Manala. The River of Tuonela is the boundary between this world and the other, where everything is reversed in relation to the world of the living.

“Viisitoista Runo / Poem 15” is an ekphrastic poem. Askeli Gallen-Kallela’s painting, <i>Lemminkäinen Äiti</i>, vividly depicts the story about a woman who brings her son back to life from the river of death. Lemminkäinen is an adventure-loving braggart and mythic hero in the <i>Kalevala</i>.
</p><p>
“Kuppi Jäkälä / Cup Lichen” is inspired by a poem of the same title by Helvi Juvonen (1919–1959). She was a Finnish writer and recipient of the Eino Leino Prize in 1957.

The poem “Ghazal: Without Sinking” refers to the music of Hildur Guðnadóttir, an Icelandic composer and cellist.

<p>
In the poem “Luck,” “A Case of You” refers to the song by Joni Mitchell.
